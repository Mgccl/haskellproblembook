Only problems with polynomial time or pseudo-polynomial time are considered. 
Most NP-Complete problem will be ignored. 
Some exponential algorithms are ok.
Of course most likely I'm writing about things not on this list.

Strings, Lists: 
KMP, some string metrics(hamming, levenshtein), edit distance/four-russian
List Shuffle (sadly must be O(n log n) time)
List permutation
LCS, LIS, SCS
n-D matrix matching(list implmentation in linear time too?)
Aho–Corasick string matching algorithm

Algebra/Number Theory:
Chien Search[Finite fields]
Group Isomorphism
Schreier–Sims algorithm[Finite Groups]
Todd–Coxeter algorithm[Presentation, Groups, Cosets]
Gröbner basis
AKS primality test
Prime Sieve
Miller-Rabin
System of linear congruence solver
Some matrix related codes(include FFT)
Automatic Groups
Euler Phi
Modular arithmetic as Monad


Randomization:
Some probability related stuffs

Searching in partial orders?

Computational Geometry:
OMG CG in Haskell, I don't think anyone has done that yet. 
To make it nice, I will only do things with integers.

Combinatorial,Other:
Linear Programming
stable marriage problem
Hungarian algorithm,Hopcroft–Karp algorithm
Fibonacci search technique
Graphs in general. DFS, Toplogical sort, BFS, Shortest Path, all pair shortest path, MST, k-th shortest path
Network flows
Sorting Network in functional language?
Day of the week
some simple stat algorithms
boolean minimization
type inference algorthm
Sethi-Ullman algorithm
Some information theory algorithms, include hamming codes, arithmetic coding(OMG)
DB related things???
Coffman–Graham algorithm
interval arithmetic
Game theory 
Parsing,context-free, regular language, logic:
CYK, Early Parser, NFA minimization, DFA minimization, NFA to DFA
Regular Expression to DFA/NFA and back.
Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm
Knuth–Bendix completion algorithm[Term Rewriting]
The Fastest and Shortest Algorithm for All Well-Defined Problems
Truth table to boolean formula
Algorithmic Lovász local lemma
Alias method and other probability related algorithms
Guess a random rational number
continued fractions as real number representation
Gosper's algorithm. Other stuff from the book A=B
Expander graph construction

wavelet transform

Data Structures:
vEB tree(possible?), actually this is a research area, should look into it.

No numerical algorithms. Since I do not want to deal with real numbers here.

Of course, Chazelle's triangulation algorithm should be on any cookbook.
